## Hello!

My name is Gabriela Aviv Becher. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I am the granddaughter of Iranian immigrants and I came to political consciousness amidst Trump-era—joining the fight for our democracy has never felt optional. 

After the 2016 election, I helped found [LA Teen GOTV](https://www.instagram.com/lateengotv/?hl=en) and I started a club called Right to Assemble at my high school—making activism accessible, sending 3,000 postcards to voters nationwide before the midterms, registering new voters at naturalization ceremonies, and planning two civics education weeks for grades 7-12. In the summer of 2018, I helped flip every red CA House seat blue, notably fmr. Rep Katie Hill, through being a founding member of [A New Tide](https://www.anewtide.org/), the youth branch of Congresswoman Karen Bass' [Sea Change PAC](https://seachangepac.org/).

(((((((other code, dance concert)))))))

My senior year of high school, I analyzed NC voter file in conjunction with Census data using Python to expose the racial discrimination of voter ID laws & felon disenfranchisement. I visualized my findings using Processing’s GeoMap library, and authored a 20 page research paper.

I deferred my admission to Brown becuase I *needed* to be on the ground during the most important election of my lifetime. So, within a week, freshly-eighteen-year-old me packed up my bags and drove to Helena to join the data team at the [Montana Democratic Party](https://montanademocrats.org) in hopes of flipping the Senate. I learned more than I ever have about organizing, SQL, campaign technologies, and being a part of a cohesive team. I became a deputy data director. We fell short and it hurt, but I am beyond grateful for every moment I had in MT and am so proud of what our team accomplished for the state's long term data infrastructure.

**I am a student, a progressive, a hiker, a reader, and not naive, but sufficiently idealistic. I'm in the fight for my 2 little sisters, my grandparents, and the organizers who do scrappy, indispensable work in their own communities.**

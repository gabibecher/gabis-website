## Hello!

My name is Gabriela Aviv Becher. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I am the granddaughter of Iranian immigrants and I came to political consciousness amidst Trump-era—joining the fight for our democracy and human rights has never felt optional. 

After the 2016 election, I helped found [LA Teen GOTV](https://www.instagram.com/lateengotv/?hl=en) and I started a club called Right to Assemble at my high school to make activism accessible. We sent 3,000+ postcards to voters nationwide before the midterms, registered new voters at naturalization ceremonies, and planned civics education weeks. In the summer of 2018, I helped flip every red CA House seat blue, notably fmr. Rep Katie Hill, through being a founding member of [A New Tide](https://www.anewtide.org/) (the youth branch of Congresswoman Karen Bass' [Sea Change PAC](https://seachangepac.org/)).

I took lots of CS classes all throughout high school, mostly working in [Processing](https://processing.org/). My favorite project was an [interactive projection](https://youtu.be/nBXnVbHJ61U?t=6) that I created for my school’s dance concert using [depth data from a Kinect sensor in real-time](https://youtu.be/JTVFNBmRcZ8).

My senior year of high school, I analyzed NC voter file in conjunction with Census data using Python to expose the racial discrimination of voter ID laws & felon disenfranchisement. I visualized my findings using Processing’s GeoMap library and authored a 20 page research paper.

I deferred my admission to Brown becuase I *needed* to be on the ground during the most important election of my lifetime. So, within a week, freshly-eighteen-year-old me packed up my bags and drove to Helena to join the data team at the [Montana Democratic Party](https://montanademocrats.org) in hopes of flipping the Senate. I learned more than I ever have about organizing, SQL, campaign technologies, and being a team player. I was hired as a data assistant and ended as a deputy data director. We fell short and it hurt, but I am beyond grateful for every moment and person I met in MT and am so proud of what our team accomplished for the state in the long run.

Now, I'm heading to apprentice on [Keala'ola Farm](https://www.kealaolafarm.com/) on the Big Island of Hawai'i for three months. I'm so excited to learn about organic farming, food insecurity, and live in community.

**I am a student, a progressive, a hiker, a reader, a tea drinker, and not naive, but sufficiently idealistic. I'm in the fight for my 2 little sisters, my grandparents, and the organizers who do scrappy, indispensable work in their own communities.**
